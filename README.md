ideah
------------

ideah is a [Haskell][1] language support plugin for [IntelliJ IDEA][2].

**NOTE**: ideah used to live exclusively on [Google Code][6], but **PLEASE
CONTRIBUTE TO THE LATEST CODE HERE ON GITHUB**.  I'll work with Oleg and
Marianna, the original authors of ideah, to deprecate Google Code. Binary
releases are still hosted on Google Code at the moment.


### Getting started

To work with the plugin, you'll need:
*  [IntelliJ IDEA 10.x or 11.x][5]. 12.x is **NOT SUPPORTED**
*  [GHC][7] (Glasgow Haskell Compiler). You can get this by installing the [Haskell Platform][13]
*  [Haskell Cabal][17] if you decided not to install Haskell Platform

All future releases will support IDEA 11.x exclusively. 10.x will not be supported.
We are working towards 12.x support.


### Current

We are happy to announce the first release! Please [report][3] bugs.

ideah supports:

*   Syntax highlighting
*   Compiling and running
*   Error and warning highlighting
*   Identifier module and type lookup
*   Comment code
*   Easy to setup
*   Documentation lookup
*   Find usages
*   Go to function declaration
*   GHCi integration

### Coming Soon

We are working on:

*   IntelliJ IDEA 12.x support
*   Hlint integration
*   Refactoring (rename and safe delete)
*   Program structure view
*   Identifer documentation and type lookup for standard/external modules

### Under Discussion

Our future plans:

*   Code formatting
*   Code autocompletion
*   Complex refactoring
*   Code intentions

Please [let us know][8] what features would be most helpful to you.

See the [wiki][9] guides for [installation/configuration][10] and [usage][12].
